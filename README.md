# intelligent-virtualenv

Talk I gave on Intelligent Virtual Environments for Cognitive Agents presented
the 2002 Australian Cognitive Science Conference. This talk was presented very
early on in my PhD and presented some of my earliest ideas for my research. 

The slides have been converted from Powerpoint to LaTeX Beamer.
