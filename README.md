# intelligent-virtualenv

Talk I gave on Intelligent Virtual Environments for Cognitive Agents presented
the 2002 Australian Cognitive Science Conference. This talk was presented very
early on in my PhD and presented some the early ideas I had for my research
primarily about shifting some of the intelligence from the agent into the
environment. 

The slides have been converted from Powerpoint to LaTeX Beamer.
